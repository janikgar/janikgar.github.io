This Ruby on Rails web app is designed to help show you information about New Orleans Regional Transit Authority routes. This includes Leaflet.js to create beautiful, readable maps, GTFS feeds to bring in up-to-date information on bus routes and locations, and a simple web-based interface designed for smartphones.

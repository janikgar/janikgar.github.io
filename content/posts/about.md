A lifelong learner and self-starter, my first experience with computers was reading the DOS 6.1 manual as a kid and writing batch scripts. Throughout my childhood and time in college, I continued to explore Linux and Python in particular.

Trained as an educator, I taught secondary music and theatre for four years and then worked in education nonprofits for another three. I made the transition to technology through the Tech Talent South (now Tech Talent Strategy).

As a data operations specialist and site reliability engineer, I advocated for adoption of cloud-native tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and modern observability solutions. My background in education also made me an advocate for continuing education and social learning within my organizations, where I led regular Lean Coffee- style sessions for new hires, mentored three new hires directly, and presented educational material for technical customer support associates on deep troubleshooting of email systems.

At home I'm a professional nerd, loving husband, and smitten father to two lovely and wiley Shiba Inus. We love cooking at home, travel, and photography.

    <p>A lifelong learner, my first encounter with programming was as a six-year-old devouring the DOS 6.1 manual to learn how to write Batch files. With some exposure to Python and graphic design in high school, I was drawn to the elegance of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create elegant web experiences.</p>

    <p>As a music teacher, I loved the challenge of creating new models to share my musical knowledge to a generation of digital natives. After some work in the nonprofit sector, I continued to discover how technology tools can hold the key to unlocking opportunities for all people.</p>

    <p>I still love music, and enjoy listening to Beethoven at the Orpheum Theater as much as tapping my toe to Shotgun Jazz Band at the Maison on Frenchman. I continue to play trumpet, sing in the choir, and occasionally play the organ at St. Charles Avenue Baptist Church.</p>

    <p>I love travel and photography! The <a href="/img/bg.jpg" target="_blank">cover image</a> on the front page was taken by me and Jared Regan.</p>

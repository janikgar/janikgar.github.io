## Jacob Garcia
*Tech Talent South Code Immersion Bootcamp*

*B.M Music Education '11, Baylor University*

*M.Ed. eLearning Technology '16, Concordia University Portland*

A lifelong learner, my first encounter with programming was as a six-year-old devouring the DOS 6.1 manual to learn how to write Batch files. With some exposure to Python and graphic design in high school, I was drawn to the elegance of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create elegant web experiences.

As a music teacher, I loved the challenge of creating new models to share my musical knowledge to a generation of digital natives. After some work in the nonprofit sector, I continued to discover how technology tools can hold the key to unlocking opportunities for all people.

I still love music, and enjoy listening to Beethoven at the Orpheum Theater as much as tapping my toe to Shotgun Jazz Band at the Maison on Frenchman. I continue to play trumpet, sing in the choir, and occasionally play the organ at St. Charles Avenue Baptist Church.
